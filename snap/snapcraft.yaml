summary: real-time media server and media proxy
description: |
  MediaMTX (formerly rtsp-simple-server) is a ready-to-use and zero-dependency 
  real-time media server and media proxy that allows to publish, 
  read, proxy, record and playback video and audio streams. 
  It has been conceived as a "media router" that routes media streams from one end to the other.

  The configuration file can be edited via `/snap/mediamtx/current/mediamtx.yml`

  Once the snap is installed, it is run as a daemon in the background. The service can be started/stopped using snap commands:

  `snap stop mediamtx`
  `snap start mediamtx`
  `snap restart mediamtx`

  This is not an official snap for MediaMTX. The code for packaging the snap can be found at https://github.com/alexdlukens/mediamtx,
  and builds versions from the original codebase at https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx.git.
